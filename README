The simppl C++ library provides high-level abstraction layers for the following
coding domains:

 * generative commandline parser framework
 * generative inifile parser framework
 * generative service-oriented IPC library introducing a C++ embedded DSL for 
   the definition of service interfaces


Compilers:

Well, I only developed on GCC >4.6. Due to the extreme usage of templating techniques and C++11 
language features I cannot guarantee that any of the code fragments will work with other compilers 
(especially VS compiler).


Status:

Most of the source is rapid prototyping. It may work or it may not. Feel free to make a 
real good project from any of the parts. I plan to make all parts of simppl fully operable 
but I can't tell you when this happens.


CopyLeft:

Feel free to do with the code whatever you want. It's free open-source code.
